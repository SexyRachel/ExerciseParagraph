        <h2> Main News 1 Universal Healthcare</h2>
            <p> My first thinking about Universal Healthcare is about to change.
                Nowadays, every person in this world should have healthcare.
                But no one cares to debate about to have universal healthcare to
                be enjoy by every Filipino in this country.

        <h3> Main News 2 Healthcare</h3>
            <p> Not all people in the Philippines has a free healthcare.
                Out of Ten family's that we have done an interview last week told us that they don't have even one plociy insurance
                So, when uncertainty comes, the family always shoulder the consequences.
